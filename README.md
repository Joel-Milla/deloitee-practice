# Deloitee landing page
This page hosts a static website that served as the final project for a course about Web Development Foundations. I applied the knowledge I acquired in HTML and CSS fundamentals. I also focused on making the website responsive to different screen sizes. I used the landing page of Deloitee, a consulting company, to hone my skills and try to replicate it.

## Features
- Contains a replica of the original contents of the Deloitee website (as seen below) where the navigation bar and the main content re-arrange to different screen sizes ensuring that the website maintains a consistent layout.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
    - Flexbox
    - CSS Grid
- Git for version control

## Self-reflection
- **Responsive Design**: Employed media queries, flexbox, and CSS Grid to adapt the layout for different screen sizes. This was the most challenging and rewarding part of the project.
- **Testing**: I extensively used Chrome Dev Tools to simulate various devices.
- **Units**: I employed fluid units like 'em' and 'vh/vw' to adjust sizing automatically based on the viewport.
